 				<p>Any Notification of Copyright Infringement provided to PeerShape Pro must contain all of the following information as set forth in the DMCA, 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3):</p>

 				<p>1. The electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest;</p>

 				<p>By E-Mail: PeerShape Pro. <a href="#"> info@PeerShape.co</a></p>

 				<p>Procedure After Notification: After PeerShape Pro&#39;s Copyright Agent receives a written notification of copyright infringement, which substantially complies with the requirements listed above, PeerShape Pro will take the following steps:</p>

 				<p>1. PeerShape Pro will disable access to or to remove the allegedly infringing material.</p>

 				<p>2. PeerShape Pro will take reasonable steps to promptly notify the person who wrote or posted the allegedly infringing material (the &quot;Alleged Infringer&quot;) that it has removed or disabled access to the material. </p>

 				<p>6. PeerShape Pro will replace the material it removed or will cease disabling access to it in not less than ten (10) and in not more than fourteen (14) business days following receipt of the Counter-Notification. It will do this unless its Copyright Agent receives a notice from the Copyright Owner that the Copyright Owner has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the Alleged Infringer from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on PeerShape Pro&#39;s system or network. PeerShape Pro must not be listed as a party to the action; any lawsuit should solely be between the Copyright Owner and the Alleged Infringer.</p>

 				<p>Counter-Notification: To send a Counter-Notification, the Alleged Infringer should provide PeerShape Pro&#39;s Copyright Agent (see name and address above) with a written statement which contains all of the following information:</p>

 				<p>1. The electronic or physical signature of the Alleged Infringer or a person authorized to act on his or her behalf.</p>

 				<p>2. Identification of the material which PeerShape Pro removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.</p>

 				<p>3. A statement under penalty of perjury that the Alleged Infringer has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.</p>

 				<p>4. The Alleged Infringer&#39;s name, address and telephone number, and a statement that the Alleged Infringer consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the Alleged Infringer&#39;s address is located. If the Alleged Infringer&#39;s address is outside the United States, the Alleged Infringer must include a statement that he or she consents to jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for any judicial district in which PeerShape Pro may be found. The Alleged Infringer&#39;s written statement must also state that he or she will accept service of process from the person who provided the original notification of copyright infringement or from that person&#39;s agent.</p>

 				<p>Misrepresentation: please note that under Section 512(f) of the DMCA, 17 U.S.C. § 512, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing, or that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability.</p>
